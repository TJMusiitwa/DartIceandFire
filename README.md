## About
This is a Flutter project that gives fans of the Ice and Fire Universe access to data about all the Books, Characters and Houses.
 An API of Ice And Fire is the world's greatest source for quantified and structured data from the universe of Ice and Fire (and the HBO series Game of Thrones). 

It is built using the [An API of Ice And Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com/) provided by [Joakim Skoog](https://twitter.com/j_skoog).

## Why build this?
Used this project as both a chance to explore this fantastic API but also to learn how to use Riverpod, a state management solution in Flutter.
